      "It's not uncommon for individuals who have undergone a significant life change or received specific training (like POSH, which stands for Positive Sexuality and Health) to experience anxiety or apprehension about social interactions. Here are some possible reasons why you may be feeling this way:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Increased self-awareness**: POSH training often aims to challenge societal norms and promote healthy attitudes towards sex, relationships, and consent. This increased self-awareness can sometimes lead to feelings of unease or discomfort when interacting with women, especially if you're not used to discussing these topics openly.\n",
      "2. **Shift in perspective on relationships**: The training may have helped you re-evaluate your expectations and boundaries in relationships, which can be uncomfortable to confront. You might be worried about coming across as insincere or awkward in conversations that previously felt natural.\n",
      "3. **Fear of being misinterpreted**: With a new understanding of respectful communication, you might be concerned that others could misinterpret your intentions or tone. This fear can prevent you from engaging with women in social situations, causing feelings of anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is the case for you, remember that it's a normal part of personal growth and development. Here are some suggestions to help you feel more comfortable:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Practice active listening**: Focus on genuinely understanding and connecting with others. Ask open-ended questions, listen attentively, and show interest in their thoughts and experiences.\n",
      "2. **Be authentic and honest**: Share your own thoughts, feelings, and desires in a respectful manner. This can help build relationships based on mutual trust and understanding.\n",
      "3. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge any negative self-talk or assumptions about women or relationships. Remember that everyone has their own stories, boundaries, and preferences.\n",
      "4. **Seek support**: Talk to trusted friends, family members, or a therapist about your feelings. They can offer guidance, reassurance, and new perspectives on relationships and communication.\n",
      "5. **Take small steps**: Gradually engage in low-stakes conversations with women who share similar interests or values. Over time, you'll become more confident and comfortable expressing yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that it's okay to feel a bit uncertain or nervous at first. With time and practice, you'll grow into these new social dynamics and develop healthier, more fulfilling relationships with others.\n"
